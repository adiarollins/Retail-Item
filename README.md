# Retail-Item

Write a class named RetailItem that holds data about an item in a retail store. The class should have the following fields:
description. The description field references a String object that holds a brief description of the item.
unitsOnHand. The unitsOnHand field is an int variable that holds the number of units currently in inventory.
price. The price field is a double that holds the itemâ€™s retail price.

Once you have written the class, write a separate program that creates three RetailItem objects and stores the following data in them:

    item1 => "Jacket", 12, 59.95
    item2 => "Designer Jeans", 40, 34.95
    item3 => "Shirt", 20, 24.95
